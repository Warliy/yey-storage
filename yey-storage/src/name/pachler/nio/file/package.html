	The name.pachler.nio.file package provides source-compatible implementation
	of JDK7's WatchService API. It only provides classes and interfaces needed
	to implement a WatchService, where the java.nio.file package in Java&nbsp;7
	offers much more functionality.<p/>
	However, all code using this package should work also with
	Java&nbsp;7's implementation of the WatchService (provided that all
	import statements are changed to import java.nio.file rather than
	this package).<p/>
	All classes in this package also exist in Java&nbsp;7's
	<code>java.nio.file</code> package
	as well, and with the exception of the 
	{@link name.pachler.nio.file.Path Path} and
	{@link name.pachler.nio.file.FileSystem FileSystem}
	classes all have the same interface, making jpathwatch a subset of
	{@link java.nio.file}.<p/>
	Note that {@link name.pachler.nio.file.Path Path}
	and {@link name.pachler.nio.file.WatchService WatchService}
	cannot be instantiated
	directly. In both JDK7 and jfilewatch factory methods are required for this;
	see	{@link name.pachler.nio.file.FileSystem FileSystem},
	{@link name.pachler.nio.file.FileSystems FileSystems} and
	{@link name.pachler.nio.file.Paths Paths} for details.
	<p>jpathwatch's WatchService implementation intends to be a non-chatty
		library - it normally never writes to standard output. However,
		certain conditions might trigger it to log warnings and errors. If you
		see log messages like this, they might indicate a bug in the library,
		so please report them on the
		<a href="http://jpathwatch.wordpress.com">jpathwatch website</a>.
	</p>
	<p>jpathwatch uses the "name.pachler.nio.file" namespace for logging, so
	logging can be turned off by calling
	<code>Logger.getLogger("name.pachler.nio.file").setLevel(Level.OFF);</code>.
	Note that this shouldn't be necessary under ordinary circumstances.
