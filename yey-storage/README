ABOUT SYNCANY
-------------
Syncany is an open-source file synchronization and filesharing application. It
allows users to backup and share certain folders of their workstations using any
kind of storage, e.g. FTP, Amazon S3 or Google Storage.

While the basic idea is similar to Dropbox and JungleDisk, Syncany is
open-source and additionally provides data encryption and more flexibility in 
erms of storage type and provider:

- Data encryption: Syncany encrypts the files locally, so that any online
  storage can be used even for sensitive data.

- Arbitrary storage: Syncany uses a plug-in based storage system. It can be 
  used with any type of remote storage.

types on http://www.syncany.org/
