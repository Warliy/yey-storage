DEVELOPMENT
-----------
Syncany is far from complete or stable. It needs a lot of work and refactoring.
If you want to help, check out the code at Launchpad and/or drop me an e-mail:
philipp.heckel@gmail.com

https://launchpad.net/syncany


1. SOURCE CODE
--------------
The code is hosted on Launchpad and uses Bazaar (bzr) as version control
system. Use the following commands to check out the latest version (trunk).

$ bzr branch lp:syncany
$ cd syncany

Inside this directory, you'll see the Syncany main application in the 'syncany'
folder, and the Nautilus extension in the 'nautilus-syncany' folder.


2. SYNCANY
----------
Syncany is almost entirely based on Java.
The development IDE is NetBeans 7.


2.1. BUILD REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
* JDK 6, or higher
* Apache Ant
* Other libraries, cp. INSTALL file or below

On Ubuntu, this should do the trick to install all dependencies:

$ sudo add-apt-repository \
    "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner"
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk ant python-notify


2.2. BUILDING & RUNNING
-----------------------
Syncany can be either built and run from within the NetBeans IDE 7, or after
it has been built using Apache Ant. After building, simple call the wrapper
script 'bin/syncany.sh' from the 'dist' directory:

$ ant
$ dist/bin/syncany.sh

To specify an alternative config directory, e.g. to start a second instance
of Syncany on the same machine, use the --config/-c parameter:

$ dist/bin/syncany.sh -c ~/.syncany2

In case you do not want to use the wrapper script, be able to run Syncany using
the command following command. Make sure that all required libraries are in the
Java classpath (-cp parameter).

$ ant
$ cd dist/
$ java -cp ... -Dsyncany.home=. -Djava.library.path=lib/ \
    -Djava.util.logging.config.file=conf/logging.conf org.syncany.Syncany


3. SYNCANY NAUTILUS EXTENSION
-----------------------------
The Syncany Nautilus extension is a fork from the Dropbox Nautilus extension.
In fact, its code is almost identical to the Dropbox version.


3.1. BUILD REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
It requires a couple of development libraries. On a Debian based system, 
simply run:

$ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libatk1.0-dev libcairo2-dev \
    libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev \
    libfreetype6-dev libpng12-dev libnautilus-extension-dev
    

3.2. BUILDING
-------------
To build the Nautilus extension, simply change to the nautilus-syncany directory
and `make` it. If you installed all dependencies, this should work.

$ cd nautilus-syncany
$ make

After successfully compiling it, you will find the library at 
dist/*/GNU-Linux-*/libnautilus-syncany.so.


3.3. INSTALLING
---------------
Nautilus extensions reside in /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/. So either you 
copy it there, or you link to it. Then restart nautilus.

$ sudo cp dist/*/GNU-Linux-*/libnautilus-syncany.so \
    /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/
$ nautilus -q && killall nautilus


3. CONFIGURATION
----------------
All important configuration can be done using the Syncany preferences window.
However, for debug/development purposes, manual configuration might be 
necessary.

By default, Syncany stores all user data at ~/.syncany (this can be changed
using the --config/-c parameter). Relative to the config directory, the 
following files and directories can be found:

- config.xml  Main configuration file. 

- cache/      Local cache that temporarily stores file chunks and metadata.
              If Syncany is not running, it can be safely deleted.
          
- db/         Derby database directory. The database is created when Syncany
              first persists any file versions. Deleting this directory
              resets the local version history. If anything doesn't work as
              expected, delete this folder and restart Syncany.
            
- profiles/   Stores the profile pictures of other users.
